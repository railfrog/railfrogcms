== Railfrog

Railfrog is a user-friendly, open-source website deployment and 
content management system built with Ruby on Rails, producing 
well structured and standards-compliant pages with Web 2.0 goodness. 
Railfrog makes it easy for developers, designers, webmasters, or 
just about anyone else to deploy and manage a website.

==== History

Railfrog has been under development since June 2005, six months before
Rails 1.0 was released. That means there's a lot of cruft, which we try
to clear out and/or keep up to date -- but we need help with this :-)

You'll find previous experimental work in svn -
    svn -r 434 co https://svn.versiondude.net/railfrog/cms/railfrog/branches
